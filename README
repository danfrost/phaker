'phake' is build/script system like make, rake... but not quite the same.

To install it:
	Grab a copy from git://github.com/danfrost/phakescripts.git
	export the 'bin/' directory into your $PATH.
	(See INSTALL)

Once installed, run 'phake'

You'll probably want to install the extra scripts:
	phake plugin install git://github.com/danfrost/phakescripts.git
