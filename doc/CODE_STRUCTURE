	bin/		(This can be built later by 'phake build bin')
		j5

	lib/ - generic code will be moved here. E.g.:

		utilties - findFileInDirs()
		Caching
		Configuration - writing and reading config
		Controllers / commands
		CLI Input		- For getting any kind of user input (will also get stuff from .ini files and, in future, from AJAX UI)
